# Scholar
+++ STILL WORK IN PROGRESS +++  
The Hugo theme "Scholar" is my personal approach to providing a great theme for your personal website.

## Installation
1. Add the repository as a git submodule inside your themes folder  
`git submodule add https://github.com/denolteholding/scholar.git themes/scholar`
2. Adjust config file (TBD, as this theme is still undergoing heavy development)

## Supported languages
I plan to support the following languages:
- English
- German
- Chinese (simplified)

## Credit
While I did create "Scholar" myself, I was heavily influenced by [Wowchemy's Academic theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-academic). If you are looking for a professional, feature-rich theme that offers frequent updates and - in my opinion - great code quality, I suggest you to look into their theme before considering this one.
I decided to build my own theme as a learning experience and to custom-tailor it to my needs, but this theme will not reach the feature-richness and matureness that Wowchemy provides.
